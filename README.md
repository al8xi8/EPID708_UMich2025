# EPID 708: Machine Learning for Epidemiologic Analysis in the Era of Big Data

## Course Overview

- **Term**: Summer 2025  
- **Language**: R  
- **Instructor**: David McCoy (david_mccoy@berkeley.edu)


### Course Description

This course focuses on recent advances in machine learning for epidemiologic analysis, particularly in the context of causal inference and prediction. Students learn to apply **Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE)** and other tools for:

- Estimating causal parameters (e.g., average treatment effects)
- Designing optimal treatment regimes
- Leveraging cloud computing for scalable implementation
