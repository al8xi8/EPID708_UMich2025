# EPID 708: Machine Learning for Epidemiologic Analysis in the Era of Big Data

This repository contains coursework, notes, and projects for the graduate-level course **EPID 708** at Purdue University. The course explores cutting-edge applications of machine learning in epidemiology, with a focus on causal inference and prediction through **Targeted Learning**.

## üìò Course Overview

- **Term**: Summer 2025  
- **Credit Hours**: 1  
- **Modality**: Residential  
- **Language**: R (preferred)  
- **Instructor**: TBD  

### üîç Course Description

This course focuses on recent advances in machine learning for epidemiologic analysis, particularly in the context of causal inference and prediction. Students learn to apply **Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE)** and other tools for:

- Estimating causal parameters (e.g., average treatment effects)
- Designing optimal treatment regimes
- Leveraging cloud computing for scalable implementation
